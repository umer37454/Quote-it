## Knowledge gained

While making this project I learned a lot about how React help in making the development faster rather than using pure JavaScript. Understand how React divide the UI pages into components and breake it down in small parts to make it easier while building it. Gained a knowledge of React concepts such as Props, State, Hooks function like useState and useEffect.
