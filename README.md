## Tools used while making this project

This project was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/React and Supabase. React is a front end framework of JavaScript that helps in building components of UI. Supabase is a backend as a service platform and is open source that allows you to create a database and provide API docs for its implementation.

## Description

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I developed a web application that allows users to upload their quotes to the website with a necessary option to include a trustworthy source and category. The application includes a filter feature that enables users to sort quotes based on their respective categories.

To enhance user engagement, I incorporated features such as like, dislike, and false buttons that allow users to express their opinion on the uploaded quotes. Additionally, the application includes a disputed mark feature that appears if a quote has a higher count of false flags than the combined count of likes and dislikes.

To ensure data accuracy, the application includes error handling features that detect invalid data submissions or missing source URLs in the proper format. The server failure error is also handled effectively.

Overall, this project showcases my skills in full-stack web development, including designing responsive user interfaces, implementing robust backend systems, and incorporating engaging features that promote user interaction.

## Knowledge gained

During the development process, I gained extensive knowledge of React and its benefits in accelerating the development process compared to using pure JavaScript. I learned how React divides UI pages into components and breaks them down into smaller parts, making it easier to build complex applications. I utilized React concepts such as Props, State, and Hooks, including useState and useEffect functions, to implement dynamic functionality and create a seamless user experience.
